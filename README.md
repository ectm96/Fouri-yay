# Fouri-yay 

A Python code that can parse cube files and generate and plot fast Fourier transforms of the data. This renders the reciprocal space data, a mathematical representation of the spatial arrangement of the particles in terms of their wave vectors. 

# Inputs

Takes cube files generated from Gaussian or Turbomole codes.
